The Boozehound
==============
A boozy but very drinkable cocktail after the ['Little Italy'](http://imbibemagazine.com/little-italy-cocktail-recipe/) and ['Nut Bunny'](https://tuxedono2.com/nut-bunny-cocktail-recipe) cocktails. Made in honor of my dear friend's PhD finishing up.

- 1 oz Sweet Vermouth
- 1/2 oz Nocino
- 1/2 oz Aperol
- 1/4 oz Lemon Juice (or less)
- 4-5 dashes Black Walnut Bitters

Stir very well in ice and strain onto an ice globe with a lemon twist.
