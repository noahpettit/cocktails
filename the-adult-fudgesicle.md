The Adult Fudgesicle
====================

In spite of the awful name, this is a very nice summer (or winter) dessert. Cocktail. The ginger beer, egg, creme de cacao base works for a lot of sipping liquors. Bourbon is the natural choice.

- 3 oz Flat Ginger Beer
- 1 oz Creme de Cacao
- 1 oz Ouzo or, Gantous and Abou Raad Arak Liqueur (my preference)
- 1 Large Egg (whole egg)
- 1 oz Bourbon

Pour all ingredients over ice and shake hard for at least 30s. Be sure the ginger beer is flat, or you'll have a real mess on your hands.
