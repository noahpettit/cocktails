Amber Road
==========

My slightly modified version, of this delicious cocktail.

- 1.5 ounces bourbon (e.g. Bulleit)
- 1 ounce of Aperol
- 1/2 ounce lemon juice
- 1/4 ounce of maple syrup
- 1-2 dashes of Angostura or Peychaudâ€™s bitters
- 2 sprigs of mint
- 2 oz soda (optional)

Add liquors and a bit of mint to cocktail shaker with ice, shake hard, strain it into a tall glass with ice. Add 2 ounces of soda, and garnish with another mint sprig. Alternatively, skip the soda and have a rocks drink, delicious
