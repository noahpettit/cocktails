Dark-n-Smokey

A very refreshing mezcal riff off of the  Dark-n-Stormy cocktail.

- 1 oz repasado tequila
- 1 oz mezcal
- 0.5 oz lime juice (or juice from a whole small lime)
- 1-2 dashes Angostora Bitters
- 4-5 oz ginger beer

Pour all ingredients over ice and give a quick stir. Garnish with a squeezed lime half.
